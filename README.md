# Conway's Game of Life
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by John Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player "game" as it requires no further input after the initial state is set. The birth and death of cells are simulated on a grid and determined by the following rules: 

1. Underpopulation - Any living cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies. 
2. Equilibrium - Any living cell with two or three live neighbours continues to live.
3. Overpopulation - Any living cell with more than three live neighbours dies from overcrowding. 
4. Reproduction - Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes alive.
